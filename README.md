# Virtual-Assistant-For-Laptop

A voice assistant's main task is to minimize input devices like keyboards, mice, touch pens, etc. This will reduce both the hardware cost and space
taken by it. This can also be an alternative for people who cannot use a keyboard, mouse, etc. 

The code is entirely made in python.

We named it Jarvis.
